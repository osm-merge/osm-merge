# osm2favorities.py

This is a simple utility that generates a GPX file from OSM data or a
GeoJson file for Osmand. This makes the data a available under **My
Places** in the Osmand menu.This is useful for a field mapping project
that covers a large area, but with a few small areas of interest. This
makes them all readily available for navigation. For some features
this program also adds Osmand styling to change the displayed icons
and colors.
